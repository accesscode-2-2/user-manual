###Honor Policy

Access Coders are expected to be honest, work hard, and be open about what they don't know.  Cheating and/or plagiarism is not tolerated.

What does cheating mean in the context of programming?  Don't programmers copy-paste each other's code?

1. You can copy-paste code as long as you attribute it to the source and you understand how it works.

2. When working in groups, make sure to name all of your collaborators.

3. Do not colloborate with any other devs for assessments.
